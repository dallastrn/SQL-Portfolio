--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--#1 How many many unique orders were placed in January?

--#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID) AS iPhone_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb ON customers.order_id = Feb.orderID
